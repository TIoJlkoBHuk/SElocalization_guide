1. First of all you need to create campaign or scernario tha you will be localizating into few languages.
You need to go to yours appdata folder and find SE folder there, and then go to mods folder and find yours Campaign\scenario folder
After you need to create folder in your campaign directory on this way 
"=Campaign name=\Scenarios\=Campaing name=\Localization" if folder <Localization> dont exist ofcourse.

2. In this folder you need add\copy 2 files for each language
   Example of 2 language localization --- https://i.imgur.com/xgx5u2M.png

-  Common.sbl -- File with config for localization of given lang. Also this example is default for EN lang, 
   for other lang you should use this name form <Common.ru.sbl> where <.ru> is lang varian, 
   so you need to cange it to your localization language.

   Here you can choose what language is default (only one default language other languages must have value = false). 
   
   For what this default language used ?
   It's used for displaying all information for players that use language that havn't localized by author,
   and game will use language by default. So try to set default language EN, for better understanding.
   
-  Common.resx -- File with localization text (this variant <Common.resx> is default, for EN lang, 
   your file need to have name like <Common.ru.resx> - for RU lang like example 
  in the end you should have something like this one
